## Lab Culture

Our lab aims for a conscious and engaged environment that is cognizant of dynamics of gender, race, and power
are vertices of encounter in academia. We are also aware of how insider/outsider and positionality inform behavior. 

### Best Practices

With these concerns in mind, we actively promote the following best practices:

1. Architectures of power-- being mindful of the roomâ€™s physical arrangement. At the beginning of lab, long tables should be broken down into smaller islands of activity. Locations of power, such as the lectern, should be systematically ceded and inverted.

2. Polyglossia-- moderate your voice. For speaker should make sure that mutliplicity of voices are promoted.

3. Peer Learning- avoid explaining and pontificating. We want to facilitate peer learning. It is best to demonstrate via tools and allowing the learner to ask leading question rather than pre-explaining.

4. Economy of attention: Do not demand attention. Voices should be kept at a "cafe" setting, and conversations should move to various islands.

5. Provide Support. Reach out to new users of the space, introduce yourself, and help them acclimatize. Ask if they need support for their project-- connect them to peer users.
