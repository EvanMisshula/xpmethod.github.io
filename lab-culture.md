Our lab aims for a conscious and engaged environment that is cognizant of
dynamics of gender, race, and power. We strive for spatial and temporal
awareness that structure the relations between center an periphery, access and
exclusion, paucity and abundance.

### Best Practices

With these concerns in mind, we actively promote the following best practices:

1. Architectures of power---being mindful of the roomâ€™s physical arrangement.
At the beginning of lab, long tables should be broken down into smaller
islands of activity. Locations of power, such as the lectern, should be
systematically ceded and inverted.

2. Polyglossia---moderate your voice. Speakers should be proactive in making
sure that a multiplicity of voices are represented in every discussion. All
soliloquies should be punctured by moments of quietude and reflection, giving
space to those hesitant to join in the discussion. Ask questions. Listen more
than you speak.

3. Peer Learning---avoid long explanations and pontificating. We want to
facilitate peer learning.

5. Economy of attention--do not demand attention. Voices should be kept at a
"cafe" setting. Yield the floor and delegate authority. Come to definite
conclusions that let's people know that you are done. Conversations should
move to various islands. Structure and preparation is a sign of respect for
your audience.
