## Lab Culture

Our lab aims for a conscious and engaged environment that is cognizant of dynamics of gender, race, and power
are vertices of encounter in academia. We are also aware of how insider/outsider and positionality inform behavior. 

## Best Practices

With these concerns in mind, we actively promote the following best practices:

1. Architectures of power-- being mindful of the roomâ€™s physical arrangement. At
the beginning of lab, long tables should be broken down into smaller islands
of activity. Locations of power, such as the lectern, should be systematically
ceeded and inverted.

2. Polyglossia-- moderate your voice. For every word spoken make sure a
mutliplicity of words are spoken by someone else.

3. Avoid over-explaining. There are plenty of structured learning. We want to
facilitate peer learning. Delegate explaination to peers.

4. Economy of attention: Do not demand attention. Voices should be kept at a
"cafe" setting, and conversations should move to various islands.

5. Provide Support. Reach out to new users of the space, introduce yourself,
and help them acclimatize. Ask if they need support for their project--
connect them to peer users.
