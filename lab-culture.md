Our lab aims for a conscious and engaged environment that is cognizant of
dynamics of gender, race, and power. We strive for spatiotemporal awareness
that structures the relations between center an periphery, access and
exclusion, paucity and abundance.

### Best Practices

With these concerns in mind, we actively promote the following best practices:

1. Architectures of power---be mindful of the roomâ€™s physical arrangement. At
the beginning of lab, long tables should be broken down into smaller islands of
activity. Locations of power, such as the lectern, should be systematically
ceded and inverted.

2. Polyglossia---help bring a multiplicity of voices into the space. We must
reach beyond networks of discipline, profession, race, gender, and class that
tend towards homogeneity. What we do in the room to redress inequality cannot
succeed if our makeup reflects power imbalances.

3. Peer Learning---avoid long explanations and pontificating. We want to
facilitate peer learning.

4. Economy of attention--do not demand attention. Voices should be kept at a
"cafe" setting. Yield the floor and delegate authority. Come to definite
conclusions that let people know that you are done. Conversations should move
to various islands. Structure and preparation is a sign of respect for your
audience. All soliloquies should be punctured by moments of quietude and
reflection, giving space to those hesitant to join in the discussion. Ask
questions. Listen more than you speak.
