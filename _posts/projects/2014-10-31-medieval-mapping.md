One of my central concerns has been to think about medieval and early modern
conceptions of space---place, landscape, and affective resonances around built
environment. I am dis-satisfied with the established practice of scanning maps,
geo-tagging them to known geography, and attaching text layers.

### Earlier

An early effort was to take eighteenth- and nineteenth-century maps of Delhi
and render them according to spatial descriptions in textual accounts of the
city. We considered creating and structuring an archive of Delhi that combined
maps, historical texts, and rich along with scholarly commentary and
annotations. Our sources included Persian histories of Delhi, such as the
*Salih-e Amal* by Kanbo, the *Ma’asir ul Umara*, and travel accounts such as
the memoirs of Bernier, Tavernier, and Dargah Quli Khan. We added detailed
descriptions of Delhi by Mirza Sangin Beg, Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan and Bashir ud
Din Ahmad. All of this information was encoded on Mughal maps of Shahjahanabad
and earlier maps of the city commissioned by British imperial administrations.

While this added a much needed spatiality to modern and early modern texts, the
question of the medieval understanding of space remained for me. I began to
think of space and place as nodes of an organizational chart.

### Then

My next effort was to represent places in the ninth century conquest
narrative-- al-Baladhuri's *Kitāb Futuh al-Buldān*-- as an [organizational
chart](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3026334/this-beautiful-19th-century-org-chart-puts-your-companys-to-shame),
jettisoning the artificiality of the cartographic imagination. I was
interested in translating circles, lines, nodes, distance from center into
campaigns, regions, areas, cities, and battles. The effort was to make an
**Argumentative Maps** that spatialized the narrative  without flattening it.
I attempted to encode into numerical data aesthetic, political, social,
cultural information in the narrative. My effort ws to get closer to seeing
*how* medieval and early modern representations of space can be visualized but
also towards making *argumentative* DH projects - projects which go beyond
scan and post.

### Later

I taught a graduate seminar on
[Borderlands](https://github.com/mananahmed/syllabi/blob/master/borderlands.md)
in Spring 2015. As part of the seminar, I also took on the exercise of
constructing a map. I worked closely with Emily Fuhrman and Jeremiah
Trinidad-Christensen. For the exercise, we picked the a tenth century
geography-- Ibn KHurdādhbih's *Kitāb Masālik wa Mamālik*-- and plotted the
journey into Sind's cities from Iran. For constructing the map, we took our
cue from James C. Scott's *The Art of Not Being Governed* where he produces a
map of walking-time of mountaineous territories. The resulting map is:
[Delivering posts by foot in medieval north
India](http://y-li.me/x/F2015002_CU_BORDERLANDS_MEDIEVAL-MAPPING/). The GIS
data was collected from various primary sources and the visualization was done
via Leaflet.js. 

### Next

In 2015-16, I am interested in teaming up with other medievalists and mappers
to take on a bigger text-- Abu'l Fazl's *Ain-i Akbāri*-- and make an
administrative map of Mughal India in the sixteenth century.
