*Plain Text* tells a story of a major morphological shift affecting culture
production in general and textuality in particular. If I were to interrupt
someone in the process of writing something in front of a computer and
ask---Where do these words reside?---I would likely receive several
conflicting answers in response. In some sense, the words reside on the
screen, where they appear to view. In another sense, they live somewhere
within the machine, on remote and often hermetically and hermeneutically
sealed surfaces: silicone chips, hard drives, flash memory cards. In yet
another sense, the visible sign is still further removed from the contexts of
its production. The word is in the wires. It spreads across servers, routers,
and data centers. One no longer reads or writes alone. Nor is the word
confined to a singular location. What was once apparent now takes on a more
complex shape, stretched between surfaces, across time and space.

The book---this book, any book---gains a new structure. I do not mean the
above figuratively. In the case of my writing words on a screen, using a
keyboard, the text forms a kind of a live lattice---a multidimensional
grid---which connects the tactile sense of the letter beneath my fingers to
its optic and electromagnetic traces. All of these sensualities are present at
once. They incorporate the totality of the synchronic text only in aggregate.
I cannot consequently pass a note to the reader digitally in the same sense
that one passes notes in class, on paper. It is impossible to give the entire
structure over to another. My text is irrevocably intertwined with my material
contexts; it literally gains another shape when recreated under system
configurations not fully congruent with my own. Much of the contemporary
anxiety about the intrusion of computational culture into the everyday points
to this fundamental reshaping of the sign, without naming it. The physical
fracture of the overall inscription leads to its multivalence. The lattice
opens a depth between the words, where forces of capital and control intervene
to monitor, monetize, censor, or correct.
