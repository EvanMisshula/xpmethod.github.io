### About

For centuries, the theories and methods of textual scholarship have presupposed the analog media of ink and paper, but the ever-growing digitality of today's texts requires us to challenge our assumptions about scholarly editing, textual scholarship, and publication. This research cluster aims to reimagine the tools and workflows of digital scholarly editing, with a focus on sustainability, scalability, and reproducibility. 

### A Digital Critical Edition for the *Vitae Illustrium Virorum* Project 
Susanna Allés-Torrent, Lecturer in Digital Humanities at the [Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures](http://laic.columbia.edu/)

At the end of the XVth century the Spaniard, Alfonso de Palencia (1423-1492), chronicle of the Catholic Kings, translated all Plutarch's *Parallel Lives* from Latin into Spanish. All these biographies had been translated since the beginning of the Quattrocento by relevant Italian humanists from Greek into Latin; Palencia didn't know the Greek language and so he took advantage of these Latin versions, first published in Rome in 1470. We know for sure which edition he used to pursue his translation: it was the third edition published in Venice in 1478 by Nicholas Jenson. In this Plutarchian corpus there were also a set of biographies written originally in Latin by several intellectuals: the *Vita Aristotelis* by Leonardo Bruni, *Vita Platonis* by Guarino Veronese, *Vita Caroli Magni* and *Vitae Hannibalis et Scipionis* by Donato Acciaiuoli. In an initial phase we plan to digitally edit this five biographies in the original version and in translation.

This experimental project aims to offer a digital critical edition while exploring effective ways to present both textes synchronically, but mostly to create a collaborative infrastructure with a sustainable workflow based on sustainability, collaboration, open source and reusability. 


The prototype is still in its very beginning phase. You can find it here <http://susannalles.github.io/Vitae/index.html>, as well as the code source in GitHub: <https://github.com/susannalles/susannalles.github.io/tree/master/Vitae>


### The Making and Knowing Project
In the same line, last year prof. Pamela Smith proposed the creation of an open access critical edition of an early modern 'book of secrets' containing technical recipies and working notes. The key was collaboration and scalability in order to integrate grad students lab notes. Check the details [here](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/events/public-discourse/pamela-smith.html).
